It's a been a little while since I've last posted. As part of my calculus class, we end the year with an exploration into a calculus related topic that we present to the rest of the class. I and my partner chose to explore the origins behind the _brachistochrone_: the curve of fastest descent for a rolling ball. Below is the related write-up I did as part of this project, and thought it might make for a good posting. It helped refine my LaTeX skills and I think is a good introduction into the field and motivations of the _calculus of variations_. Now that summer is right around the corner, hopefully I'll be able to write more in the coming months. For now, I hope this will do.
