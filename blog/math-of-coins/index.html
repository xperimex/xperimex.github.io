              <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11QVoapNuz4T8A/giphy.gif" alt="Spinning Coin"></p>
<p><strong>Coins!</strong> As some of you may relate to this, I love to take a coin, and just spin it on a flat surface or table. It&#39;s just satisfying, but being put to shame by the so called &quot;Fidget Spinner&quot;. I was spinning a coin a few days ago, and was ultimately bored at the time, so I decided to ask myself a simple question: <strong>What  information from the coin can be taken away from it spinning?</strong> This then was taken into is there a <strong>correlation</strong>, or ratio, between the <strong>rate at which the coin rotates</strong>, and the <strong>rate at which it &quot;wobbles&quot;</strong>. With a goal in mind, I picked up my pencil and started to work things out.</p>
<p>First things first, defining and finding all of our givens:</p>
<p><img src="/img/coinRep2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This diagram represents what the coin might look like at a given instance.</p>
<p>What we know about the coin:</p>
<p>The <strong>radius</strong> of our coin $= R$<br>
The <strong>circumference</strong> of our coin $C = 2 \pi R$<br></p>
<p>Now for the circle our coin rotates and wobbles upon:</p>
<p>The <strong>radius</strong> of this circle is entirely dependant on the angle of the coin to the horizontal (table/flat surface. We will define that as $\theta$). Using the diagram, we can find that $r = R \cos (\theta)$ <br>
The <strong>circumference</strong> is $c = 2 \pi R \cos (\theta)$</p>
<p>With all the givens that we need out of the way, on to the application.</p>
<p>A thing to note is that as the coin completes a <strong>full rotation</strong> around the smaller circle, the <strong>original placement of the coin moves by a certain amount</strong>. You can easily demonstrate this by drawing an arrow on a quarter, and guiding it through a rotation on a circle smaller than the quarter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/img/quarter2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>This was the quarter I used when getting ideas on how the coin behaved.</center>

<p><br></p>
<p>This extra distance it covers can easily be thought out to be as $C - c$.</p>
<center>$C - c = 2 \pi R - 2 \pi R \cos (\theta) = 2 \pi R (1 - \cos(\theta))$</center>

<p>$2 \pi R (1 - \cos(\theta)) =$ the rate at which the distance our coin completes per revolution.</p>
<p>The rate for the distance per revolution our coin completes while &quot;wobbling&quot; is the same as the circumference our coin moves around upon, which we know is $2 \pi R \cos(\theta)$</p>
<p>Putting these two together as ratio of rate of rotation, to rate of &quot;wobbling&quot;, we get:</p>
<center> $\frac{\textrm{Rate of Spinning}}{\textrm{Rate of Wobbling}} = \frac{2 \pi R \cos (1 - \theta)}{2 \pi R cos (\theta)}$<br><br> $\large= \frac{1}{\cos (\theta)} - 1$ </center>


<p>This expression represents that at any given moment, the ratio between how fast the coin is spinning, and the how fast the coin is &quot;wobbling&quot; (which can be seen as the amount of hertz produced by the coin), will be $\frac{1}{\cos (\theta)} - 1$. This also means that if you multiply the frequency of &quot;wobbling&quot; by this expression, it will output how fast the coin should be spinning at the given value of theta. For example, let&#39;s say the coin is wobbling at a frequency of $5\,hertz$ at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}\,radians$ (because radians are cool), the coin would have to be rotating about $4.52\,revolutions\,a\,second$ to maintain that angle to the horizontal at that &quot;wobbling&quot; frequency (because of how hertz measure $cycles\,per\,second$, the cycles translate into revolutions for the output). </p>
<p>Of course, this is all theoretical. In practice, the coin may slip. Wind may change the local air pressure, thus changing the air resistance. Everything needs to stay <strong>constant</strong>, with no disturbances or changes occuring during the coin&#39;s movement. But this is still a neat thing if you were to ask me!</p>
<p>Just to recap, we took the basics and givens of our coin and it&#39;s enviornment. Used those to get the generalized rates of the coin spinning and wobbling. We then used those calculate our ratio between the two at a given instant. Not bad!</p>
